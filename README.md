A customer, called Bob, is considering purchasing a house and is applying for a mortgage from a mortgage broker, called
MBR. The broker company has a web portal that Bob enters, finds a form he needs to fill-out and enters appropriate
information into it: his name, address, phone number, and information about his employer. The result of the submission is
either an error message, if some information is missing, or it is a confirmation that all information Bob filled in on the form
was received. Bob is informed that some information is required from his employer and he is provided with his mortgage
application number and some additional information that he is to provide to the employer. Bob is also informed that he can
login into the broker’s portal and view the status of his application.
Bob finds out that to obtain information from his employer, he needs to use his employer’s portal to fill-out a form to
request that the employer supply the requested information to the mortgage broker. Bob enters his employer’s portal, finds
appropriate menu option that, when selected, asks him for his employee ID and then authenticates him. Once Bob is
authenticated, he is asked to fill-out a form to supply information provided by the broker, which includes Bob’s mortgage
application number and address of the broker’s web service that is to be used by the employer to submit information about
Bob. Furthermore, the form also requests consent to provide information about Bob to the mortgage broker and, once Bob
agrees (clicks on the Agree button on the form), the employer’s portal invokes a web service that retrieves Bob’s
information from the employer’s DB and then automatically submits it to the broker by invoking the broker’s web service
and passing it information about Bob. Of course, Bob is informed of the result.
